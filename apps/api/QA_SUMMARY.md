## Changes Made

### Python 3.11 Enforcement
- âœ… Updated `apps/api/pyproject.toml`: Added `[project] requires-python = ">=3.11"`
- âœ… Dockerfile already uses Python 3.11 (no change needed)
- âœ… Created `.github/workflows/ci.yml` with Python 3.11 setup and version gate

### Ruff Gate (Already Passing)
- âœ… Added Ruff gate to CI workflow: `ruff check . --output-format=github`
- âœ… 0 errors confirmed from Phase 1.1

### Pytest Smoke Tests
- âœ… Created `apps/api/tests/` directory
- âœ… Created `test_health_endpoint.py`: Tests GET /health â†’ 200 OK
- âœ… Created `test_auth_no_token.py`: Tests GET /api/v1/auth/me â†’ 401
- âœ… Created `test_rate_limit_init.py`: Tests app startup and rate limiter init
- âœ… Added pytest step to CI workflow

### Runtime Smoke Test
- âœ… Created `docker-compose.test.yml` in project root
- âœ… Configured Redis and API services with health checks
- âœ… Added runtime smoke test job to CI workflow
- âœ… Includes log error checking

### MyPy Blocking Errors
- âœ… Fixed: Added type annotation to `setup_prometheus(app: "FastAPI", environment: str)`
- âœ… Added test directory override in `mypy.ini`
- âœ… Added MyPy gate to CI workflow with error count check

### Node Version Gate (P1)
- âœ… Updated `apps/web/.nvmrc` from `20` to `18.17.0`
- âœ… Added Node version gate to CI workflow

### Documentation
- âœ… Created `QUALITY_GATE.md` with SSOT criteria
- âœ… Created `apps/api/QA_SUMMARY.md` with evidence and artifacts

### CI Artifacts
- âœ… Configured artifact uploads:
  - `pytest-report.txt`
  - `mypy.txt`
  - `health-log.txt`
  - `runtime-logs.txt`
  - `node-version.txt`
  - `python-version.txt`

## Test Execution

### Local Verification Commands

```bash
# Python 3.11 check
python --version  # Should show 3.11.x

# Ruff check
cd apps/api && ruff check .

# MyPy check
cd apps/api && mypy . --config-file mypy.ini | grep -c "error:"  # Should be 0

# Pytest smoke tests
cd apps/api
export SECRET_KEY=test-secret-key-minimum-32-chars-long-1234567890
export JWT_SECRET=$SECRET_KEY
export DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///./test.db
export REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379/0
export ENVIRONMENT=test
export DISABLE_RATE_LIMIT=true
pytest tests -v

# Runtime health check
docker compose -f docker-compose.test.yml up -d
sleep 10
curl http://localhost:8000/health
docker compose -f docker-compose.test.yml down

# Node version check
cd apps/web && cat .nvmrc  # Should show 18.17.0
```

## Next Steps

1. **Merge PR**: After CI passes, merge "Phase 1.2: Quality Gate PASS âœ…"
2. **Phase 2**: Proceed to MyPy warnings remediation (target: â‰¤40 warnings)
3. **Monitor**: Ensure all P0 gates remain green in subsequent commits

## Notes

- All changes are minimal and focused on quality gates only
- No business logic changes were made
- Existing Ruff fixes from Phase 1.1 are preserved
- CI workflow will run on push and PR events
